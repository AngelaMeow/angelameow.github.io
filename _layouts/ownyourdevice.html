      <h3>Nintendo 2DS and 3DS</h3>
      <p>The closure of Nintendo's eShop and online services revealed an uncomfortable truth: millions of people never really owned the games they paid for. Do you want to know if it's a good idea to hack a 2ds o 3ds? Here are some reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>True ownership through backups and preservation: With the eShop permanently closed, your digital purchases are gone forever if your console breaks. CFW lets you back up games, saves, and system data—meaning you actually own what you paid for, not just a revocable license.</li>
        <li>Region-free access: Games often cost significantly more in certain regions, and some titles never release in others at all. CFW removes these artificial barriers, letting you buy and play games from any region—leveling the playing field regardless of where you live.</li>
        <li>Independence from corporate server shutdowns: When <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u">Nintendo killed their online services</a>, millions of stock 3DS users lost functionality they paid for. CFW users can connect to community-run alternatives like Pretendo Network, ensuring the device remains fully functional even after the company decides to abandon it.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <h4>Finding affordable consoles</h4>
      <p>Since it's an old device, it'll be better and easier to get a second hand item. </p>

        <li>You can also check eBay and other secondhand marketplaces. Since the goal is repurposing, buying used makes more sense than buying new. </li>

    <!-- Wii -->
    <div class="oyd-gallery-item">
      <h3>Nintendo Wii</h3>
      <p>The Nintendo Wii is the perfect console for families or any group, as the control mechanics simulate many real-life movements. This <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11478887/">Research</a> explores the benefits of Wii gaming for elderly people.</p> 
      <p>But like the 3DS, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u">Nintendo killed their online services</a> in 2019—taking with it every digital purchase users had made. Here are some reasons to mod a Wii:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Accessible motion controls for all ages: Unlike traditional controllers, the Wii Remote mimics real-world actions—bowling, tennis, boxing. This makes it ideal for elderly users, physical rehabilitation, or anyone intimidated by complex button layouts.</li>
  <li>Digital purchases disappeared overnight: When Nintendo closed the Wii Shop Channel, users lost access to hundreds of Virtual Console games they had paid for. Homebrew lets you preserve and back up your library so this can't happen again.</li>
  <li>Extremely affordable entry point: Currently is one of the cheapest ways to access a massive game library and introduce motion gaming to communities with limited budgets.</li>
</ol>

      <h3>Nintendo WiiU</h3>
      <p>With 8GB of storage, no eShop (Because <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u">Nintendo killed their online services</a>), and a ticking time bomb in some models' memory chips, the Wii U was practically designed to be modded.</p>
