I'm Angela, a Honduran Graphic and UI Designer based in Spain, with over 7 years of experience in the software development field.

![angela velasquez](../images/img-angela-landscape.png)

For the past 6 years, I’ve worked as a UI Designer within product and development teams. I’ve also contributed as a UX consultant, helped define design systems, and supported product exploration for MVPs. Additionally, I have solid experience with WordPress—both theme customization and custom builds—and styling front-end frameworks. This technical skillset allows me to collaborate closely with developers and ensure smooth design-to-development integrations.
