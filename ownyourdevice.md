## Longlife to Videogames and other "obsolete" devices 

Many functional devices become "obsolete" each decade not because they stop working, but because manufacturers end software support. This is the result of my critical inquiry: a collection of resources for identifying, repurposing, (and hopefully) redistributing the devices to extend their lifespan, reduce e-waste.

### How this idea can create Community Value?
An extended device lifespan of devices that could end up being Technology waste can fight e-waste. At the core of this initiative is the "Own Your Device" philosophy: if we purchased it, we should control what software runs on it and the right to repair it and modify it. It's already included in legal frameworks like the EU Right to Repair, which makes repair easier and more accessible for consumers. And there are target communities like Elderly Care Facilities Nursing Homes, Assisted Living, Schools in Underserved Areas, Refugee & Immigration Support Centers. They can benefit improving entertainment (music, videos, games), dignity, communication and other areas. 

### Where can you start? 
Here is the list of resources to mod/hack consoles:
