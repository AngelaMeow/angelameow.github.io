title: Enterprise UX for Organization
---

## Overview

Calvert Impact Capital is a non-profit in the Financial Industry. I collaborated with a complete team as a UX/UI designer, when I worked at a Software Development Company. We were doing Enterprise UX for their organization Platform.

## My Role was...
The goal was to deliver a user friendly platform that allowed different user roles (Advisors, Investors and Admins) to manage information and transactions. We launched the project after a few months of development, and we maintain the engagement for iterations a couple of months after. My role was as a support designer at the beginning, and then I transitioned to lead designer of the team.
