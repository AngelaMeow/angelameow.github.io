### Overview

During my time at Acklen Avenue I collaborated in the Internship Career Path for Designers.

*Mentoring-ish*

#### My role as a mentor included:

- *Weekly 1:1s:* Online meeting structured in two parts. The first 30 minutes were dedicated for a quick check up and(1:1 talk), and the other half was for pairing, in order to help them in execution and decision making. 
- *Review of their work:* I dedicated a specific amount of hours weekly to review their work, both for training and the work they were doing for internal or client projects. 
- *Training material and resources*: We met monthly with the Design Team Leader to refine resources needed and to make sure interns will have eveything for their training. 


Additionally, I collaborated in the interview process for the Design Team. I learned how to conduct pair design sessions, and how to create an appropriate environment when conducting them.
