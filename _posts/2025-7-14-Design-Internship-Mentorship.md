### Overview

During my time at Acklen Avenue I collaborated in the Internship Career Path for Designers.

*Mentoring-ish*

#### My role as a mentor included:

- *Weekly 1:1s:* Online meeting structured in two parts. The first 30 minutes were dedicated for checking up and 1:1 talk, and 30 minutes of pairing to help them and guide them in the execution and technical skills.
- *Review of their work:* I dedicated a specific amount of hours weekly to review their work, both for training and when they were contributing to small projects. 
- *Training material and resources*: We met monthly with my Design Team Leader to define what resources we needed and to make sure the interns could have all they needed to keep their training.

Additionally, I had also collaborate in the interview process for refining candidates lists for the Design Team. I learned from my peers how to conduct pair designing sessions, and how to create an appropriate environment when conducting the sessions.
