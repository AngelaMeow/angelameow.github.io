### Overview

MUA is a non profit organization in Honduras that works towards promoting culture, arts and education with an inclusive and fair perspective. We had the opportunity to work in the past, they gave me the opportunity to take my professional practice in order to get my Graphic designer degree.

Now that they have reached out for UX/Technical consulting. We have worked together to identify the need and solutions to their current projects. 

They have developed a few new local programs to promote culture and create spaces. What we discover during the first consultation was: 

A solution to create and maintain online portals/sites that was easy to use for any person in the organization. The ideal scenario was to find a tool that didn’t require advanced technical skills, other than regular computer and internet usage. 
An option to document and present the process and achievements of the projects. Due to the amount of work, reports, resources and material we needed a feasible solution to “host” all that media. 


### The soultion & My role
After a couple of initial meetings, and collecting the requirements, we agreed on building the platforms using Wordpress.
Due to the characteristics of the client and projects we worked a bit more freely, on a bi-weekly basis (synching via e-mail one or two times per week for smaller items), it was challenging at the beginning because we were in the middle of lockdown, but everything worked out as expected. 

The projects we have published included: 

#### Improving Infrastructure Strategy 
Changing Hosting services so that we could have appropriate services for the organization, and customer support that could help non-technical admins with struggles related to backend and hosting. 

#### MUA (Institutional Portal) 

IMG - Cover 
This is the newest project we have been working on (Currently iterating content and pages). The main goal with this is to have a single Parent Portal that can host and present all the information of the programs and initiatives that the organization develops. 

##### Keeping consistency 
The second goal was translating their Styleguide into a Design System and Wordpress Theme. To have officially a new custom theme that represents their identity and goes in line with their brand communication.

##### Documenting process 
The other big part of the deliverables was an entire library of step by step tutorials for the Wordpress Site. The organization works with volunteers and a lot of them or even their employees don’t have experience working with CMS or websites. So having these type of resources is useful for them while they get familiar with the interfaces.

#### Pakas
This was a pre-existing Wordpress site, before we started our engagement. During 2020’s lockdown they launched some online resources, such as workshops and video tutorials in collaboration with local artists, oriented to people interested in arts and culture. They needed to build a portal to formalize the project and get funding. But the tools and infrastructure defined at the moment were not scalable. 

That’s when we started analysing, planning and developing their new platforms.
The site is still online: https://pakashn.com/ but we are currently migrating and consolidating all the MUA projects and initiatives under: their new institutional site: https://muahn.com/

### Lessons Learned

- Working on a project after they had kicked off it, it’s always challenging. In the case of the Pakas project there were some tools and libraries that were going to be too difficult to change completely (time, budget and effort) and we had to adapt to make it work with what we have at the moment. 
- Helping with Non-profit cultural/art projects is really refreshing, even tho is behind the scenes just doing the “nerdy” work haha. It makes me feel good. 
- Adapt my own process to the schedules and resources, and support other people with my technical expertise. On a daily basis (with Software development teams) I am the non-tech-ish person of the group “The Designer”.
