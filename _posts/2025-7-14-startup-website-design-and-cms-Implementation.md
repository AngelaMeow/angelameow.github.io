### Overview

Last year I collaborated with a couple Startups, both companiess were already familiar with CMS tools and they had already implemented an initial version of their sites. 
The main problem we decided to solve was the lack of customization and scalability. Especially for non-technical team members to manage content. 

### The solution

We designed and developed custom themes for both projects. We implemented custom tools to manage and customize their branding, visuals and the content with arefreshed and modern look. Ensuring a feaseble Enterprise UX for the editors, who already had experience updating content and blogs, but struggled with blockers or limitations with previous themes. Additionally, we make sure to adapt the projects for scalability to implement new features, install and manage plugins, and new allow team members to learn and work efficiently.

### Methodology

We worked implementing the Agile methodology as the following: 

#### Discovery
There was a discovery session at the beginning of the engagement, and a few follow-up discovery sessions after the first launch. It took place in the first two weeks of the Engagement. 

#### Definition 
The definition was the extraction of the business and user requirements and Epics to have as a base for the creation of users stories to develop

#### Build-Measure-Learn
A loop of Planning, Designing and Developing, and finally Testing. And repeating the process on a Weekly Sprint basis so that we could complete the templates. The build-measure-learn goal was to give value continuously and maximize the customer satisfaction, reduce risk, and improve product quality.

#### Launch + Handoff
The official installation of the theme work, documentation and any notes and training delivered.

The result was a new theme launched and installed in the Public sites. We also worked closely with Product, Content and Marketing teams to set up the tool and plugin for A/B testing, SEO, and Analytics for optimization. 

The documentation part was also a big chunk of effort. Documenting the theme structure (owned by the company) and also the wordpress process (tutorials and steps for new editors). 

### Lessons Learned

Through the projects, we encounter challenges and even after some iterations: 

- Working with Start-ups is a unique experience, You have to be open minded for constant changes in OKRs and priorities, as on the overall business level. 
- Collaborating with teams other than technology is always hectic, but also efficient for achieving business goals.
- In Spanish we have a saying *“Más vale malo conocido que bueno por conocer”* in English it would be something like “Better the bad you know than the good you don't”, and I'm talking about Drag and Drop editor Tools. Elementor is the Bad that we know and Thrive editor the Good to know. Selecting plugins and tools for wordpress can be tricky, sometimes more than looking at reviews and how well supported it is, time will give you the answers.
